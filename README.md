#     Comprehensive-analysis-of-Gym-membership-and-Gym-members-exercise

## I. Introduction

### Objective: 

  1. In this project Gym member exercise dataset  provides a detailed overview of gym exercise, how it is important to get physical attributes, and fitness metrics, and it improves gym members overall health by calories burn..
  
  2. Tools and Technologies: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook.

### Goals:

  1. Adhere to standard interaction conventions.
  
  2. Ensure consistency and readability across the project.
  
  3. Total no of male n female Gym members in both dataset .
  
  4. Provide comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
  
  5. Document the project thoroughly for clarity and reproducibility.
  
  6. Comprehensive analysis of Gym members' calories burn and their dream weight  gain

## II. Data Acquisition and Cleaning

  ### Data sources
  
   1. `Gym Members Exercise Dataset` (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset/data)
  
   2. `Gym Membership Dataset`(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ka66ledata/gym-membership-dataset)

### Instructions

  1. Clone the repository in V S code 

  https://github.com/Pratikpant2020/Comprehensive-analysis-of-Gym-membership-and-Gym-members-exercise.git

  
  2. Access the repository from your command line 

### Virtual Environment set up instructions

  1. After you have cloned the repo to your machine, navigate to the project folder in GitBash/Terminal.
  
  2. Install a virtual environment. The command in Gitbash is python -m venv venv
  
  3. Activate the virtual environment. The command in Gitbash is source venv/scripts/activate for windows
  
  4. Install the requirements.txt file to install necessary packages by running pip install requirements.txt or pip list.(python 3.12.8 used to create the project)

### Data Cleaning and Merging
  
   1. Clean datasets using Pandas (handling missing values, correcting data types).
  
   2. Merge these two datasets on common attributes and calculate new values such as average days per week .

## IV. Data Analysis and Visualization

  ### Visualizations
  
   1. Create at least three visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn, such as:barplots for calories burned.
  
   2. Develop a Tableau dashboard to present key insights interactively.
   
### Data Dictionary
  
   1. Develop a custom data dictionary to explain all variables and data points, included in the documentation.

## VI. Data Interpretation and Documentation

 ### Code Annotation
  
   1. Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to annotate the code, explaining each step of the analysis.
   
   2. Ensure clear and concise comments within the code.
   
   3.  Summary of findings and interpretations, highlighting any observed trends or correlations.
  
## VII. Review and Polishing
  
  ### Internal Review
    
   1. Perform a thorough review to ensure the project meets all requirements.
   
   2. Verify the accuracy and readability of visual components.
