# Comprehensive-analysis-of-Gym-membership-and-Gym-members-exercise-

Introduction
Objective: This project Gym member exercise dataset  provides a detailed overview of gym exercise, how it is important to get physical attributes, and fitness metrics, and it improves gym members overall health by calories burn..
Tools and Technologies: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook.

Goals:
Adhere to standard interaction conventions.
Ensure consistency and readability across the project.
Total no of male n female Gym members with the same age range.
Provide comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
Document the project thoroughly for clarity and reproducibility.
Comprehensive analysis of Gym members' calories burn and their dream weight  gain

II. Data Acquisition and Cleaning

Loading Data
Gym Members Exercise Dataset 
Gym Membership Dataset
Data Cleaning and Merging
Clean datasets using Pandas (handling missing values, correcting data types).
Merge datasets on common attributes and calculate new values such as average calories burn.

IV. Data Analysis and Visualization
Visualizations
Create at least three visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn, such as:
Line plots for calories burned.
Develop a Tableau dashboard to present key insights interactively.
V. Best Practices Implementation
