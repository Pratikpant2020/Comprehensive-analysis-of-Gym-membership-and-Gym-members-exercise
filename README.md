# Comprehensive-analysis-of-Gym-membership-and-Gym-members-exercise-

Introduction
Objective: 
  1: This project Gym member exercise dataset  provides a detailed overview of gym exercise, how it is important to get physical attributes, and fitness metrics, and it improves gym members overall health by calories burn..
  2: Tools and Technologies: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook.

Goals:
  1: Adhere to standard interaction conventions.
  2: Ensure consistency and readability across the project.
  3: Total no of male n female Gym members with the same age range.
  4: Provide comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
  5: Document the project thoroughly for clarity and reproducibility.
  6: Comprehensive analysis of Gym members' calories burn and their dream weight  gain

II. Data Acquisition and Cleaning

  Loading Data
  2: Gym Members Exercise Dataset 
  3: Gym Membership Dataset
  
  Data Cleaning and Merging
  1: Clean datasets using Pandas (handling missing values, correcting data types).
  2: Merge datasets on common attributes and calculate new values such as average calories burn.

IV. Data Analysis and Visualization
  Visualizations
  1: Create at least three visualizations using Matplotlib or Seaborn, such as:Line plots for calories burned.
  2: Develop a Tableau dashboard to present key insights interactively.
  
V. Best Practices Implementation
  1: Virtual Environment
  2: Set up a virtual environment and provide setup instructions in the README.
  3: Data Dictionary
  4: Develop a custom data dictionary to explain all variables and data points, included in the documentation.

VI. Data Interpretation and Documentation
  Code Annotation
   1: Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to annotate the code, explaining each step of the analysis.
   2: Ensure clear and concise comments within the code.
  Project Documentation
    Write a comprehensive README.md file covering:
      1: Project overview and objectives.
      2: Data sources and cleaning steps.
      3: Analysis and visualization methods.
      4: Instructions for setting up the environment and running the project.
      5: Summary of findings and interpretations, highlighting any observed trends or correlations.

VII. Review and Polishing
  Internal Review
    1: Perform a thorough review to ensure the project meets all requirements.
    2:Verify the accuracy and readability of visual components.
